As you already know, my name is NGUESSIE Loïc. I am 23 year old and I live in Nanterre (Hauts-de-Seine department). I went to the Paul Eluard high school in Nanterre (city in the Hauts-de-Seine department), and I quickly discovered my interest in mathematics. I've made it a priority in my school path. In parallel with the courses, my passion took an important place in my young life of teenager. It regulated and punctuated my days, my schedule and my interests.
Unfortunately, not everyone is lucky enough to make his passion for living, especially when it is to soccer, in the Paris area.
Having quickly become aware of this situation, I decided to focus all my time on my studies. Added to that, my organization, my will to reach my goals and my audacity, I have today the ambition to be at the head of an information system department within an important structure.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to find experience in my field right away. Don't panic, everything comes to those who know waiting. End of the first academic year in May 2018, I still hadn't responses from the companies I was targeting, so still no interview. At this point, work experience still wasn't exhaustive for advancement to the next year. 

I couldn't see myself doing more than 3 months at home without doing anything, so I wasn't looking for a 'developer internship, data analyst' jobs or any other titles related to my major. I was looking for a summer job."
